## LATE START TIME
Here at SummerTech School, we value health. Because our students are developers, we know that working through the night to "just fix that bug" is necessary. However, early start times like 7:30 or 8:00 AM do not allow for students to get more than one hour of sleep, if that. This is why we have a late start time -- until NY State finds out...

## CLASS TIME
Here at SummerTech School, we value a broad range of education.
This is why classes are different each day of the week.
* Monday: Algorithms and data structures
* Tuesday: Blockchain Development
* Wednesday: Computer Science
* Thursday: JavaScript Development
* Friday: Students' Choice!

## PERSONAL INSTRUCTION
Here at SummerTech School, we value the student's decision to learn what he/she wants to learn!
This is why students get to choose the area in software development that they would like to learn, one-on-one. All instructors are masters of everything.

## LUNCH
Here at SummerTech School, we don't value starvation. This is why lunch time is one full hour long!

## CODING TIME
Here at SummerTech School, we value your desire to code!
Coding time is a 90 miunute coding period that happens each day. At SummerTech School, we value students engaging in collaborative projects. This is why 'Coding Time' alternates between collaborative coding and personal coding every other day.

## PERSONAL EVALUATION
Here at SummerTech School, we value each day. This is why it is required for all students and instructors to evaluate their day, to see what they could have done better for the future. This is also a time to talk with your instructor about non-programming related things, like your personal life!
